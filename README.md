# VK
VK stands for Vasudev Kutumbakam. 
The projet consist of 2 main parts : Language tranlation and Language detection.

Since thereâ€™s an increasing utilization of mobile gadgets, the idea of mobile and 
omnipresent computation is becoming an extremely significant aspect of our daily lives due to 
its rising processing power, vast storage capacity, simple user experience, and enhanced network 
infrastructure.
There are nearly 6,500 spoken languages globally, and 4,500 of them have more than 1000 
speakers. In information communication, language has been a significant barrier for centuries.
 Therefore, here we are choosing Android as a platform to develop an android-
 based language translation application that solves the significant languages commonly spoken 
 around the world. The android-based system provides a solution for people who can't read a 
 language because they don't share a common language, or for other purposes.
In this project, we are creating an android application which will have 3 different modules that 
will be based on bilingual functions and will also let users know the exact translation of a word 
or a sentence.
Thus, this feature can be used by people travelling to various places where there is language 
barrier and even to communicate with friends/relatives/colleagues.
